<h1>Thoughts</h1>

So far, I've been hastily completing all of the projects from The Odin Project's curriculum, doing the bare minimum and ensuring that only the base requirements were met in a basic manner.

However, now that I am nearing the end of the Front End portion of the curriculum, I wish to aggressively expand my knowledge of React and the libraries surrounding its fundamentals. It's why in my previous projects I had implemented Sass and Typescript alongside learning Functional React, Class-based react etc.

This is the second-last project in the front-end portion, and here I am implementing three new substantial utilites. A component library in the form of ShadcnUI/RadixUI, Redux a global state management system and react router.
