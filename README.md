# storeFront
Replication of a store-front page alongside a shopping cart, shopping pages. Created to practise React, TS, Redux, Tailwind and Shadcn/UI.

<h1>Thoughts</h1>

So far, I have been hastily completing all of the projects from The Odin Project's curriculum, doing the bare minimum and ensuring that only the base requirements were met in a basic manner.

However, now that I am nearing the end of the Front End portion of the curriculum, I wish to aggressively expand my knowledge of React and the libraries surrounding its fundamentals. It's why in my previous projects I had implemented Sass and Typescript alongside learning Functional React, Class-based react etc.

This is the second-last project in the front-end portion, and here I am implementing three new substantial utilites. A component library in the form of shadcnUI/RadixUI, Redux a global state management system and react router.

<h1>Finishing thoughts - July 5 2023</h1>

Well, it has been around two days since I began this project, and it's already done. I did not believe that controlling state outside of the component tree would improve my efficieny in such a manner. When creating the componenets I did not have to worry about how the state and its modifier functions were passed through each individual element. I'm glad that I learned how to use Redux, as I can imagine that its usefulness will increase once working on projects much larger in scale, consisting of multiple reducers. 

Using shadcn/ui was incredibly easy, its innate compatibility with Tailwind allowed for me to easily alter the components provided to my taste, and gain a rudimentary understanding of these components. 

<h2>Pitfall 1: No Testing</h2>

I absolutely despise testing, as it completely contradicts the nature of my programming style: going with the flow and solving errors as they come along. I will not however, refute the value of test driven development and writing tests and thus the next project that I will be working on will be strictly written in a Test-Driven-Development manner.

<h2>Pitfall 2: Not enough commits</h2>

Another consequence of my programming style is that I am often swept up in completing a component fully, then committing the changes. Oftentimes this leads to sweeping changes being shown within the git history, not accurately portraying the development progress of the project.

I will be working on addressing these pitfalls within the next project that I work on. It seems that I've covered most of the things within Front End Development.

Framework: React
State: Redux
Styling: shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS

Looks like all that's left is auxiliary libraries that add extra features, I am particularly keen on exploring charts.js
